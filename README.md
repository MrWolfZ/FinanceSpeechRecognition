This is a simple project written in F# that allows the user to dictate financial transactions. The transactions will then be saved in a file on the user's desktop in [QIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Interchange_Format) format.

Here are some examples that are understood by the program:

- spent 15 dollars at wall mart for entertainment 3 days ago
- spent 6.42 at wall mart for groceries yesterday
- spent 8 euros for dining out at restaurant on August 7th
